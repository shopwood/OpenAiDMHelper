# Setup
Go get yourself an OpenAI API key. (Tip, sign up for a free one for a month, and then spend ten dollar. It will last you a long time.)

Set you API key in powershell (I'm using windows) with:

    $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = 'MY API KEY'

If you want to make it perminent you need to set it in the user vaiables in the system properties in windows.
